					Indie Game: The Movie is the first feature documentary film about making video games. It looks 
					specifically at the underdogs of the video game industry, indie game developers, who sacrifice 
					money, health and sanity to realize their lifelong dreams of sharing their visions with the 
					world.</p>

					<p>After two years of painstaking work, designer Edmund McMillen and programmer Tommy Refenes 
					await the release of their first major game for Xbox, Super Meat Boy the adventures of a skin-
					less boy in search of his girlfriend, who is made of bandages. At PAX, a major video-game expo, 
					developer Phil Fish unveils his highly anticipated, four-years-in-the-making FEZ. Jonathan Blow 
					considers beginning a new game after creating Braid, one of the highest-rated games of all time. 
					Four developers, three games, and one ultimate goal to express oneself through a video game.</p>

					<p>Indie Game: The Movie is about the creative process and putting yourself out there through your 
					work. It’s a journey many filmmakers, creators, artists, entrepreneurs - many people, can 
					relate to in the digital era.</p>

					<p>Feature Documentary, 96 mins</p>
