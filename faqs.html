				<h2>Is the film available in any other languages? </h2>
				<p>Yes. Indie Game: The Movie is available in 20 subtitled 
				<br>languages: Arabic, Traditional Chinese, Czech, Dutch, 
				<br>English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, 
				<br>Italian, Japanese, Portugese, Polish, Russian, Spanish, 
				<br>Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian
				<br>
				<br>Courtesy of some wonderful volunteers from around 
				<br>the world. Big thanks to all of them!</p>

				<h2>What's so Special about the Special Edition?</h2>
				<p>Short Answer:  A lot :)   
				<br>
				<br>Contains everything we wanted to put in the movie 
				<br>but couldn't fit.  In shooting this film, we accumulated 
				<br>over 300 hours of footage and interviewed many 
				<br>developers - the majority of whom ended up not fitting 
				<br>in the film. As a result we have a multitude of great 
				<br>stories and interesting moments that we couldn't share 
				<br>in the original film.  It was tragic.  But, not too 
				<br>tragic as it lead to the birth of IGTM Special Edition.
				<br>
				<br>Pieces for the Special Edition are...
				<br>
				<br>- Team Meat Audio Commentary
				<br>- Jason Rohrer &amp; Passage
				<br>- Alec Holowka &amp; Derek Yu
				<br>- David Hellman &amp; The Art of Braid
				<br>- Jenovoa Chen &amp; That Game Company
				<br>- Phil Fish Epilogue
				<br>- Behind the Scenes of Indie Game: The Movie
				<br>- Game Developer Conference Q&amp;A with ALL people 
				<br>   in the film
				<br>- And much, much  more...</p>
